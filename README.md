This project was submitted as my final project for my Introduction to C++ Programming course. I was required to find a real world issue and solve it using elementary C++ functions.

The program was written and tested on Mac OS using Xcode. 
For Mac users, drag the 'licenseplate.txt' file to your Desktop. Open the Xcode project. Within the main.cpp, on lines 120 & 130, change "/Users/brandonwidow/Desktop/licenseplate.txt" to "/Users/*yourname*/Desktop/licenseplate.txt" OR to whatever directory path you have placed the licenseplate.txt file. Then run the file.

You can use the 'characters.txt' file to swap out the characters in the 'licenseplate.txt' line by line (time consuming, but it works).

Any criticism is welcomed!

Thanks, Brandon Widow
